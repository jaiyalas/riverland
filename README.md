## TODO

### syntax

+ [ ] lambda abs/app
+ [x] isolated non-linear context

+ [x] reversed program translator
+ [ ] get rid of MatEq
+ [ ] fixed-point (for recursion)
+ [ ] -----
+ [ ] no need for GC/throwing used variable away (this should be prevented by type-checker)
+ [ ] shouldn't deal with name conflict (as we using env)
+ [ ] require: `(let ... in ... , let ... in ...)` aka ...?
+ [ ] closure needs env (ref: River)
